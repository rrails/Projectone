Questions
2. Where to put the user name?

4. Fix the show after capturing a call

Only the organiser should be able to update the meetings

after user captures a meeting - what should they see?
after updating user - where should we go?

User show
  - ensure start time is before end time

Users
  - Individual User details
    - they can edit and delete
    - they can see their meetings
    - when logging on see your meetings
